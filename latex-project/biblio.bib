ABSTRACT = {Atmospheric pollution results from toxic gases in low concentrations, originating from natural processes and human activities. These gases interact with each other in the presence of solar radiation, forming much more complex compounds that contribute to the formation of photochemical smog. This study presents a mathematical model to estimate the daily concentrations of primary and secondary pollutants, assuming that spatial variation is not considered within a control volume. The model includes nitrogen oxides, ozone, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, and other gases, which are related through 52 chemical and photochemical reactions with rate constants that depend on factors such as the time of day and temperature. The model formulation results in 31 ordinary differential equations that are solved using a variable-step algorithm in MATLAB R2019a. Two scenarios are simulated: the “closed-box” model (CBM), where there are no inflows or outflows of gaseous flux, and the “open-box” model (OBM), which includes inflows and outflows within the control volume. The OBM is particularly useful for predicting concentrations during thermal inversion episodes. The results show that several pollutants reach their maximum concentrations at midday, suggesting an increase in the formation of secondary pollutants under high solar radiation, especially in the closed-box model. In the open-box model, concentration peaks shift toward the afternoon. To compare both models, the closed-box system conditions are considered, incorporating airflow into the open-box model without accounting for pollutants transported by this flow. The complex nonlinear dynamics observed in the pollutants highlight the combined influence of solar radiation, temperature, and emission rates on air quality. This study underscores the usefulness of mathematical models in developing effective mitigation strategies and assessing environmental and public health impacts.},

abstract = {Abstract A sensitivity/uncertainty analysis is performed on a mechanism describing the chemistry of the polluted troposphere. General features of the photochemical reaction system are outlined together with an assessment of the uncertainties associated with the formulations of mechanistic details and rate data. The combined effects of sensitivity and uncertainty are determined using the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) method. The results of this analysis identify the key parameters influencing the chemistry of NO2, O3, and PAN. Based on these findings, a series of recommendations are made for future experimental kinetic studies.},

abstract = {A comprehensive study of numerical techniques for solving the atmospheric diffusion equation is reported. Operator splitting methods are examined in which the three-dimensional problem is converted into a sequence of one-dimensional problems. A Galerkin, linear finite element scheme with a nonlinear filter is found to be computationally superior to the other methods tested for the advection-diffusion components. The chemical reaction dynamics component, treated within the splitting scheme, is generally highly stiff. A second-order predictor, iterated corrector technique, in combination with an asymptotic treatment of the stiff components, is found to be computationally superior for the chemical kinetics. The validity of the pseudo steady state approximation for certain reactive species is also investigated.}

abstract = {A photochemical model incorporating plume dilution effects was used to estimate the fractions of NOx and hydrocarbons remaining in an urban plume after travel distances on the order of 80–330 km from the urban area. The model considered variable input parameters such as initial concentrations, time of day of plume emergence from the urban area, and atmospheric stability, but did not consider deposition. Approximately 15–20% of the NOx and 25–30% of the olefins that were initially present at 11:00 am remained in the plume at 10:00pm. Predicted NOx transformation rates of 5–20%h−1 were in good agreement with recent measurements for urban plumes from Boston and Phoenix. The calculations also showed that plumes dispersing over long distances exhibited diurnal variations of NOx typical of the urban atmosphere. However, the magnitude of the secondary NOx peak was negligible in comparison to the primary peak, suggesting that very small amounts of NOx are transferred to the background in chemical forms that can produce additional NO and NO2 by photolytic processes on the second day. Larger HC/NOx ratios led to much higher downwind O3 levels and thus lower NOx and olefin concentrations. Changes in atmospheric stability substantially altered the species concentration profiles, but compensating factors resulted in insignificant differences in the fractions of the species remaining for different atmospheric stability conditions.}

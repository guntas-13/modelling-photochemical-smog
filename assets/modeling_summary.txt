INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:

1. LEVEL 1 - Simple Photostationary Model:
   • Shows fundamental NO-NO₂-O₃ cycle
   • Demonstrates rapid equilibration between species
   • Sensitivity analysis reveals importance of photolysis rate
   • Use for: Teaching basic photochemistry, quick estimates

2. LEVEL 2 - Box Model with Emissions and Ventilation:
   • Reproduces realistic diurnal ozone pattern
   • Morning NO₂ peak from traffic emissions
   • Afternoon O₃ peak from photochemical reactions
   • Evening NO₂ increase (evening traffic rush)
   • Use for: Urban air quality forecasting, impact assessment

3. LEVEL 3 - Scenario Analysis:
   • Quantifies effectiveness of control strategies
   • NOₓ reduction less effective than expected (VOC-limited regime)
   • Ventilation improvements provide moderate benefit
   • Combined strategies most effective
   • Use for: Policy evaluation, emission control planning

KEY INSIGHTS:

• Diurnal Pattern: O₃ lags behind NOₓ emissions due to reaction kinetics
• Ozone Weekend Effect: Would be visible with weekday/weekend cycling
• VOC-NOₓ Trade-off: Different regimes show NOₓ vs VOC sensitivity
• Boundary Layer: Ventilation rate strongly influences peak concentrations
• Peak Timing: Depends on meteorology (sunlight, ventilation)

NEXT STEPS:

1. Validate with real data (EPA AQS database)
2. Calibrate emission rates for your city
3. Add VOC speciation (propane, ethene, toluene, etc.)
4. Include aerosol formation and surface reactions
5. Expand to 3D photochemical model for regional transport
